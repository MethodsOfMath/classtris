Uses processing.js for the blackboard. Hold down mouse to draw. Type letters to write where the mouse is pointing. Click the screen to change the text location.
 Click E to erase the blackboard. Click colors to switch colors. Click the plus and minus to change the size of the pen.
 
 I've been working on adding a way to upload text documents. JavaScript has been taunting me by briefly showing the imported text and reloading the page and reseting it. So I commited the code out. I was using the method proposed by This Could Be Better https://thiscouldbebetter.wordpress.com/2012/12/18/loading-editing-and-saving-a-text-file-in-html5-using-javascrip/
